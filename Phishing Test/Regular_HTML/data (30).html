UNITED WE FALL?<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout.<br>
American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent<br>
company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for <br>
Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September,<br>
but it's not much consolation to airline employees,<br>
shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.<br>
<br>
The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of<br>
American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay<br>
off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight<br>
amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make<br>
for longer layovers. &quot;In the past, airlines were loath to have<br>
longer connection times because flights were listed in travel<br>
agents' computers by elapsed time,&quot; said the Journal. &quot;Now,<br>
online booking tools and search engines most often list flights<br>
by price, not time.&quot; In this age of penny-pinching, American's<br>
worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US<br>
Air and United. <br>
<br>
Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its<br>
parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster.<br>
Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price<br>
may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an<br>
increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air<br>
Transportation Stabilization Board. &quot;The ATSB expects an<br>
applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions <br>
to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S.<br>
taxpayers' interests,&quot; said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for<br>
uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, <br>
which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring <br>
$498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the<br>
36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor<br>
frustration. <br>
<br>
The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and<br>
non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. &quot;The U.S.<br>
government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and<br>
federal loan guarantees&quot; while &quot;European authorities have acted<br>
more wisely,&quot; letting Swissair and Sabena &quot;go to the wall,&quot; said <br>
the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should <br>
let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline<br>
industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and<br>
Canada 3000. Paging Charles Darwin to the white courtesy<br>
phone... - Jen Muehlbauer<br>

SLEEPING WITH THE PENGUIN<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which opened yesterday in<br>
San Francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellows ever to <br>
lie down with a stuffed penguin: Microsoft and Sun. These are<br>
companies that once referred to Linux as a &quot;bathtub of code&quot;<br>
(Sun) and &quot;a cancer&quot; (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown<br>
paper the San Jose Mercury News.<br>
<br>
Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute<br>
numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on<br>
server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in<br>
the entire year.<br>
<br>
Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at <br>
the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the<br>
Seattle Times this way: &quot;Microsoft executive Peter Houston<br>
wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld<br>
... until he heard about the pie cannon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft <br>
will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- &quot;a place where <br>
you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,&quot;<br>
deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: <br>
&quot;Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to<br>
grow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press<br>
release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus<br>
Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon<br>
Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to<br>
scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a<br>
version of Linux, to be called &quot;Solinux.&quot; How time does make<br>
April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon <br>
Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems<br>
demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first<br>
general-purpose servers running Linux.<br>
<br>
The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude<br>
toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but<br>
to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some<br>
of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it.<br>
&quot;Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun<br>
servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running<br>
Linux,&quot; Poletti reported. And you thought Microsoft hated Linux? <br>
