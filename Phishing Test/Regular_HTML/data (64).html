&nbsp;Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to <br>
&nbsp;Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing<br>
<br>
Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise <br>
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE® software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance<br>
of <br>
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.<br>
<br>
Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors<br>
Technology, Inc. today<br>
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in<br>
e-security.® This strategic<br>
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security<br>
protocol used by every e-based<br>
desktop, laptop and server. <br>
<br>
Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors<br>
Technology's award-winning Magi<br>
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and<br>
encryption to every<br>
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow<br>
between workgroups within and<br>
beyond the enterprise.<br>
<br>
Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly<br>
network infrastructures. This<br>
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific<br>
security tools for each desktop<br>
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration<br>
can now be rapidly, easily and<br>
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,<br>
partners and clients without concern<br>
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact<br>
highly securely with strong<br>
encryption and authentication across firewalls.<br>
<br>
&quot;In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,&quot; says<br>
Bernard Hulme, chairman and<br>
CEO of Endeavors Technology. &quot;Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT<br>
managers with added<br>
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric<br>
peer-to-peer computing&quot;<br>
<br>
Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete<br>
interoperability between<br>
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID® two-factor authentication, RSA<br>
ClearTrust® Web access<br>
management, RSA BSAFE® encryption and RSA Keon® digital certificate management.<br>
<br>
The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging<br>
and advertising, be listed in<br>
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.<br>
It will also lead to joint<br>
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on<br>
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide<br>
business continuity support.<br>
<br>
&quot;Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise<br>
products and streamlining the<br>
deployment process for IT managers,&quot; says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. &quot;By<br>
combining our products,<br>
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.&quot;<br>
