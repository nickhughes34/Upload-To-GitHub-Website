Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships<br>
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been <br>
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding <br>
government-issued credit cards?<br>
<br>
(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.<br>
<br>
(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.<br>
<br>
(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf <br>
membership.<br>
<br>
(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative &quot;river <br>
rock&quot; at a military base in the Arabian desert.<br>
<br>
(e) all of the above.<br>
<br>
&quot;Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, <br>
Libertarian Party executive director. &quot;Thanks to the federal <br>
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, <br>
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.&quot;<br>
<br>
The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office <br>
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in &quot;seemingly <br>
unneeded expenditures&quot; made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and <br>
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax <br>
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees <br>
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 <br>
billion in goods and services, the audit found.<br>
<br>
In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and <br>
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, <br>
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to <br>
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their <br>
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a <br>
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling <br>
suit?&quot; asked Dasbach. &quot;Americans who support a bigger defense budget, <br>
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, <br>
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the <br>
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even <br>
imagine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury <br>
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and <br>
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit <br>
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can <br>
be &quot;a useful tool for building good relations with a host country&quot; <br>
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. <br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found &quot;little evidence of <br>
documented disciplinary action&quot; against those who misused the cards, <br>
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&quot;It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat <br>
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse <br>
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard <br>
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to <br>
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, <br>
instead of offending the taxpayer.&quot;<br>
