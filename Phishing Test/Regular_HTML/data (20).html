&quot;A Houston woman has been arrested for running over her <br>
husband three times and killing him with her Mercedes.&nbsp; The <br>
woman claims it was an accident. Three times.&nbsp; That shows you <br>
what a smooth ride the Mercedes is.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;It’s been reported that the couple from ABC’s reality show <br>
&quot;The Bachelor,&quot; has broken up.&nbsp; It’s not surprising since <br>
studies show that 60% of fake TV marriages end in divorce.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Conan O'Brien<br>
<br>
&quot;You know 'that look' women get when they want sex? Me <br>
neither.&quot;<br>

Things You'll Never Hear A Man Say...<br>
<br>
1. I just love how Barry Manilow sings, don't you?<br>
2. No, I don't want another beer. I have to work tomorrow.<br>
3. You know, her breasts are just too big for my liking.<br>
4. Sometimes I just want to be held.<br>
5. Boy, that Barbara Walters on &quot;20/20&quot; is one sexy babe.<br>
6. Sure, honey! I'd be happy to discuss the state of our <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; relationship.<br>
7. We haven't been to the mall for ages. Let's go shopping and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I can hold your purse.<br>
8. Forget Monday Night Football. Let's watch something <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; meaningful on the &quot;Lifetime Channel.&quot;<br>
9. It's late. Put your clothes back on and I'll take you home.<br>
10. Honey, I'm going to the store. Do you need more tampons?<br>
11. Actually, I prefer it when *you* hold the remote.<br>
12. I'm sick of beer. Give me a fruit juice.<br>
13. Great! Your mother's coming to stay with us again.<br>
14. I wonder if my gorgeous neighbour knows that her drapes are <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; open when she's getting ready for bed. Maybe I should tell <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; her.<br>
15. No way. You weeded the garden last week. It's my turn.<br>
16. Better get rid of these old Playboy magazines. I don't <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; look at them any more.<br>
17. I understand.<br>
18. This movie has way too much gratuitous nudity.<br>
19. Damn, we're late for church!<br>
20. No! I don't want to see your sister's breasts.<br>
21. Damn these onions, pass me a tissue.<br>
22. Put some panties on, for Pete's sake.<br>
23. Eat something! You are starting to look like a Victoria's <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Secret Model!<br>
24. Don't pick that up, I got it.<br>
25. Happy Anniversary!<br>
26. Hey, isn't today your Mother's birthday?<br>
27. Let's talk. I miss talking.<br>
28. Gay men have rights too!<br>
29. I am just too tired to have sex again today!<br>
30. Are you losing weight, sweetie?<br>
