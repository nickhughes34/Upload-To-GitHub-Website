<font size="2"><div class="PlainText">_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. â€œTrying to re-create the &quot;Good <br>
Easy[2]&quot; on a Windows machine.â€&#157; I have also made half-hearted attempts in <br>
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say <br>
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with <br>
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, <br>
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I <br>
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step <br>
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. <br>
<br>
I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most <br>
common programs. &quot;0 Control Panel[3]&quot;, &quot;1 Mozilla[4]&quot;, &quot;2 Emacs[5]&quot;, &quot;3 DOS <br>
home&quot;, &quot;4 DOS work&quot;, &quot;5 DOS incoming&quot; (each of which gives me a command line, <br>
but in different directories), &quot;7 Python[6]&quot;, &quot;9 IE&quot;. Also &quot;# Explorer home&quot;, <br>
&quot;$ Explorer work&quot;, &quot;% Explorer incoming&quot;, which open Explorer windows in <br>
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only <br>
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went <br>
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus <br>
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique <br>
first letters as needed. &quot;Ad-aware[7]&quot;, &quot;Excel[8]&quot;, &quot;IM&quot;, &quot;Netscape 4[9]&quot;, <br>
&quot;Paint Shop Pro&quot;, &quot;Query Tool (ODBC)[10]&quot;, &quot;VMWare[11]&quot;, &quot;Word[12]&quot;. All other <br>
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete <br>
&quot;Accessories&quot;. Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a <br>
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like <br>
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean <br>
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. <br>
<br>
On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens <br>
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your <br>
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a <br>
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for <br>
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always <br>
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them <br>
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). <br>
<br>
I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a <br>
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, <br>
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And <br>
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I <br>
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to <br>
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x <br>
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the <br>
window. <br>
<br>
In Mozilla, I set my home page to &quot;about:blank&quot;, set Internet Search to search <br>
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible <br>
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for <br>
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the <br>
background). Under Scripts &amp; Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open <br>
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, <br>
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes <br>
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], <br>
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. <br>
<br>
In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since <br>
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between <br>
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, <br>
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and <br>
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. <br>
<br>
I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is <br>
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named <br>
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which <br>
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this <br>
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which <br>
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files <br>
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI <br>
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell <br>
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the <br>
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept &quot;y&quot; and &quot;n&quot; for <br>
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when <br>
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get <br>
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My <br>
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. <br>
<br>
I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On <br>
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal <br>
projects, each under CVS controlâ€”also set as my home directory using the <br>
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work <br>
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for <br>
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for <br>
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly <br>
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. <br>
<br>
I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email <br>
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal <br>
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in <br>
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank <br>
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses <br>
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is <br>
my single most backed-up possession. <br>
<br>
Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI<br>
[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].<br>
