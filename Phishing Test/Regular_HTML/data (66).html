<br>
Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record<br>
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. <br>
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of<br>
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers<br>
over the past 12 months. <br>
<br>
And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the<br>
average moggy, it claims to have &quot;firm evidence&quot; that the majority are real.<br>
<br>
<br>
Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the<br>
critics and doubters, adding: &quot;I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same<br>
realm as the Loch Ness monster. <br>
<br>
&quot;But it's not, they are really out there.&quot; <br>
<br>
'Cats with cubs' <br>
<br>
Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the<br>
country. <br>
<br>
Big cat reports&nbsp; <br>
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire <br>
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx <br>
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat <br>
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London <br>
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales&nbsp; <br>
&quot;This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,<br>
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. <br>
<br>
But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in<br>
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have had sightings of cats with cubs,&quot; he added. <br>
<br>
'Trigger camera' <br>
<br>
The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including<br>
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. <br>
<br>
But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public<br>
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. <br>
<br>
A national &quot;trigger camera&quot; project is planned which, the society hopes,<br>
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. <br>
<br>
Mr Bamping said: &quot;The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and<br>
take a picture of itself.&quot; <br>
<br>
'Like dogs' <br>
<br>
The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the<br>
wild, or their descendants. <br>
<br>
Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: &quot;In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big<br>
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. <br>
<br>
&quot;But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people<br>
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them<br>
down, or take them to a zoo.&quot;<br>
