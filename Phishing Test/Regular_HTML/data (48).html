&gt;&gt;&gt; See, that's downright disgusting that Apple won't even acknowledge<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; our existence.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; While I agree that their position is not good, I think that you&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; have to think<br>
&gt;&gt; that their business is the manufacture and sale of their products.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm not asking them to promote our groups prominently.&nbsp; I just want&nbsp; <br>
&gt; them to<br>
&gt; publicly acknowledge our existence in a proud fashion and not&nbsp; <br>
&gt; hesitate to<br>
&gt; mention us to their customers when appropriate.<br>
<br>
When is an 'appropriate' time?<br>
<br>
And how do Apple decide which User Groups to 'acknowledge in a proud&nbsp; <br>
fashion'<br>
There are groups out there that only have a dozen or so members.&nbsp; <br>
Others seem to a large portion of members still using PowerPC based&nbsp; <br>
machines. And from my experience, it seems very few 'traditional' user&nbsp; <br>
groups actually cater for the demographic that Apple is now chasing.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; Years ago, the local store did allow us to meet there twice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; Once in the<br>
&gt;&gt; first year of their existence, once in the second.&nbsp; The attitude&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; towards us<br>
&gt;&gt; during the second visit was not as good as the first.&nbsp; Despite the&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; fact that<br>
&gt;&gt; our group was the ideal audience and perfectly behaved during both&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; visits<br>
&gt;&gt; (not that that's ever an issue with our group, but I wanted to make&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; it clear<br>
&gt;&gt; that I saw no reason for the attitude). &gt;.<br>
<br>
What makes your group 'an ideal audience'?<br>
I'm suggesting that you aren't... In fact, I am curious to see how ALL&nbsp; <br>
User Groups feel about this point!<br>
Are User Groups in fact the 'ideal audience' for Apple? Or would Apple&nbsp; <br>
just be preaching to the converted?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; finding a place to hold your meetings is just a function of that&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; task. They<br>
&gt;&gt; are your meetings, no one elses.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The store had indicated that they would provide the<br>
&gt; program/presentation/presenter.&nbsp; Are we supposed to come up with a&nbsp; <br>
&gt; backup<br>
&gt; presentation and presenter for every meeting we plan, in case the&nbsp; <br>
&gt; meeting<br>
&gt; falls through?&nbsp; Not really gonna happen and I doubt any user groups&nbsp; <br>
&gt; do that<br>
&gt; (except for occasions where they have reason to believe an out-of-town<br>
&gt; presenter's appearance could fall through).<br>
<br>
Over at my own website, I recently highlighted a series of posts from&nbsp; <br>
O'Reilly on how to deal with Speaker Cancelations<br>
<a href="http://www.appleusers.org/share/oreilly-share-how-to-deal-with-speaker-cancelations/">http://www.appleusers.org/share/oreilly-share-how-to-deal-with-speaker-cancelations/</a><br>
<br>
EVERY group I have ever known has had to deal with this one time or&nbsp; <br>
another... I've been in the situation where I've had to find a last&nbsp; <br>
minute replacement OR usually BE the last minute replacement. Yes it&nbsp; <br>
is embarrassing, but these things do unfortunately happen.<br>
<br>
I've even been known to be the cause of such cancelations to groups&nbsp; <br>
myself :(<br>
Often I'm booked month's in advance to present to a group... then&nbsp; <br>
circumstances change and I have to cancel.<br>
Other times, I've had initial discussions about presenting, again&nbsp; <br>
months in advance, and then I hear nothing until the night before the&nbsp; <br>
presentation... asking if am I still OK with 'tomorrow' !@#!$!$^ <br>
%&amp;^*(Q@# is all I can say.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of ways of gently reminding a presenter that they&nbsp; <br>
have a presentation coming up soon... and harking back to the original&nbsp; <br>
topic of this thread... a forwarding of a Press Release you've sent&nbsp; <br>
out a month before the meeting that mentions the 'forthcoming meeting&nbsp; <br>
next month' is one simple way of doing so. It also shows that you care&nbsp; <br>
enough about the topic/presenter to promote it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; That really annoyed we board members, because we were made to look&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; like<br>
&gt;&gt; idiots and our general membership was highly disappointed.&nbsp; We&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; swore that we<br>
&gt;&gt; would never do anything involving that store ever again. &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; So far everything that you have written about has ha a negative&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; approach<br>
&gt;&gt; slant.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Everything about the situation was negative.&nbsp; I don't see any point in<br>
&gt; putting a smiley face on it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The only positive that came about was for the board to swear we will&nbsp; <br>
&gt; never<br>
&gt; rely on that store again.&nbsp; We now have the freedom of not relying on&nbsp; <br>
&gt; such<br>
&gt; careless individuals for the focus of one of our meetings.<br>
<br>
How much communication did you have with the Store leading up to the&nbsp; <br>
'presentation'?<br>
Surely, you weren't discussing things even the week before the meeting&nbsp; <br>
and they still just let you turn up<br>
<br>
I know of instances where User Groups have made plans with Apple&nbsp; <br>
Retail Stores...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; With regard to User Groups, there is no excuse.&nbsp; Everything&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; about our<br>
&gt;&gt; groups<br>
&gt;&gt; is centered around furthering the usefulness of Apple products.&nbsp; We&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; provide<br>
&gt;&gt; a positive, family-friendly, intelligent resource to Mac users.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; How is that<br>
&gt;&gt; not something to let the world know about? &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I agree. But then I say, get out and bang the drum, do we really&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt; need Apple?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes, we really do.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Increasingly, the average owner/user of Apple products thinks that&nbsp; <br>
&gt; the local<br>
&gt; Apple Store is the one and only place for to further the Apple&nbsp; <br>
&gt; experience.<br>
<br>
In many cases, it is the best place for many people.<br>
I hate to say it, but I cringe at some of the comments I see on User&nbsp; <br>
Group mailing lists etc about what a product may or may not do and how&nbsp; <br>
wrong those responses are!<br>
An example I've seen twice on different lists in recent weeks is the&nbsp; <br>
point about iPads and if they are 'locked' to AT&amp;T...; for starters&nbsp; <br>
both people inquiring were talking about iPads with WiFi only - so&nbsp; <br>
automatically there is no need to even mention been locked in to&nbsp; <br>
AT&amp;T.;&nbsp; Secondly, both groups were located in Australia and whilst one&nbsp; <br>
was talking about importing an iPad from the US, the other was asking&nbsp; <br>
if they could use it in the UK when they visited family there later in&nbsp; <br>
the year.<br>
Steve Jobs made it abundantly clear in his Keynote speech launching&nbsp; <br>
the iPad that it was NOT locked to any carrier... yet on both MUG&nbsp; <br>
lists, people responded saying the iPad was likely to be locked in to&nbsp; <br>
AT&amp;T; and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the iPad as&nbsp; <br>
they had hoped... which was just plain wrong!<br>
<br>
Now, I not saying that User Groups always get it wrong... more often&nbsp; <br>
then not they don't and they do actually provide an independent&nbsp; <br>
viewpoint... for example, the discussion on this very list about how&nbsp; <br>
best to demo an iPad was very enlightening and provided far more&nbsp; <br>
information on the topic then I got out of my contacts at Apple&nbsp; <br>
Australian (and Apple US) on how do do the same thing when the iPhone&nbsp; <br>
first came out here (about 18 months AFTER the US go it - so it wasn't&nbsp; <br>
exactly the latest news then and I'm sure others had similar queries&nbsp; <br>
at&nbsp; the time).<br>
<br>
&gt; The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media&nbsp; <br>
&gt; presence.<br>
<br>
Then it is up to User Groups to address that themselves.... which&nbsp; <br>
again harks back to the original topic of this thread<br>
<br>
Here in Australia, we have taken steps towards addressing this... I&nbsp; <br>
produced a full page flyer promoting active Apple User Groups here.<br>
<br>
See Page 15 of the Feb/Mar issue of the AppleUsers Spotlight (a 30&#43;&nbsp; <br>
page digital format magazine I publish here in Australia) for an&nbsp; <br>
example of the ad.<br>
<a href="http://www.appleusers.org/magazine/february-2010-issue-of-appleusers-spotlight-now-available/">http://www.appleusers.org/magazine/february-2010-issue-of-appleusers-spotlight-now-available/</a><br>
<br>
The 'electronic' copy of the flyer has each user group name as an&nbsp; <br>
active hyperlink, so people can jump straight to a group in their state.<br>
If it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer, then there is still the&nbsp; <br>
simple URL that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with&nbsp; <br>
links to the various groups own webpages.<br>
<br>
The 'primary' URL used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and&nbsp; <br>
everyone agreed that we wouldn't use the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/usergroup">www.apple.com/au/usergroup</a>&nbsp; <br>
link (or even the <a href="http://www.apple.com.au/usergroup">www.apple.com.au/usergroup</a> one) as quite a few of&nbsp; <br>
the 'active' groups here have chosen NOT to be listed there - so they&nbsp; <br>
can be seen as been independent from Apple (and any other retailer)&nbsp; <br>
and also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date.<br>
<br>
<br>
I just realised that the ad needs updating - we don't mention the iPad&nbsp; <br>
in the current version :)<br>
<br>
We also have a portrait version on hand if we need it... in fact, the&nbsp; <br>
flyer started out as an A4 size portrait flyer when we were approached&nbsp; <br>
to have an ad in one of Australian Macworld's Super Guide publications&nbsp; <br>
- unfortunately we couldn't arrange enough funding to go ahead with&nbsp; <br>
the idea in the time frame at hand... but now we have a solid basis to&nbsp; <br>
work from the next time an opportunity presents itself<br>
<br>
There is nothing stopping a group of User Groups in a 'state',&nbsp; <br>
'region' or 'area' from getting together and producing their own&nbsp; <br>
version of such an ad.<br>
<br>
I also love what Mac Users UK have done with their Google map showing&nbsp; <br>
the location of each User Group in the UK (and Ireland)<br>
<a href="http://www.macusersuk.org/mugs/mugsmap.php">http://www.macusersuk.org/mugs/mugsmap.php</a>&nbsp; I really must work out how&nbsp; <br>
to create such a Map for Australian User Groups :)<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Let me make an analogy...&nbsp; At music fairs like Lollapalooza and&nbsp; <br>
&gt; Lilith Fair,<br>
&gt; there are secondary stages where lots of great musicians and groups&nbsp; <br>
&gt; get<br>
&gt; major exposure.&nbsp; They're not getting the limelight, but they sure&nbsp; <br>
&gt; get in<br>
&gt; front of lots of people they wouldn't otherwise.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Not only do we not get secondary stage placement, but we can't even&nbsp; <br>
&gt; hang out<br>
&gt; at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out&nbsp; <br>
&gt; flyers<br>
&gt; about our groups.<br>
<br>
Actually, most 'concerts' and major events organisers discourage&nbsp; <br>
'hawkers' from 'hassling' people at the gates/entrance... but they'll&nbsp; <br>
quite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession&nbsp; <br>
stand near by (and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as&nbsp; <br>
well)<br>
<br>
And why should Apple be expected do the marketing for independent User&nbsp; <br>
Groups???<br>
Yes, I know User Groups 'promote' Apple products... but we have chosen&nbsp; <br>
to do so... we aren't compelled to do so.<br>
We come together in User Groups (or even in online communities such as&nbsp; <br>
this) to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a&nbsp; <br>
common topic of interest to us... just like there are groups that get&nbsp; <br>
together as book clubs, or reptile keepers, even &quot;gunzels&quot; get&nbsp; <br>
together through their common interest in trains (real ones and model&nbsp; <br>
ones).&nbsp; No one makes them form these groups nor force people to&nbsp; <br>
participate... and most other 'hobbies' aren't so (un)fortunate to&nbsp; <br>
have a 'central' business or entity to focus around, yet they survive&nbsp; <br>
and even flourish all by themselves.<br>
