<font size="2"><div class="PlainText">It is based on the fact that the 'official installer' overwrites files<br>
belonging to debian packages.&nbsp; When those packages someday get upgraded,<br>
they overwrite what the nvidia driver installed, and then things break.<br>
I have helped enough people fix that kind of mess to know.<br>
<br>
Just a simple fact.&nbsp; Overwriting packages owned by a package is always<br>
a bad idea no matter how it is done, because someday the package will<br>
overwrite it back on you.<br>
<br>
&gt; What tricked me yesterday: Why don't I get the 2.6.32-4 kernel that<br>
&gt; works with the 195.36.15 Nvidia driver although I have<br>
&gt; linux-image-2.6-amd64 installed? I had to install it manually. The<br>
&gt; document states<br>
&gt; &quot;amd64: Any AMD or Intel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apt-get install linux-image-2.6-amd64 ... That<br>
&gt; will keep you running the latest kernel released by Debian&quot;<br>
<br>
linux-image-2.6-X is not updated right away unfortunately in the case<br>
of unstable (and sometimes testing).&nbsp; It should always be up to date in<br>
stable though.&nbsp; I have never quite figured out how the kernel packagers<br>
decide when to update it.<br>
<br>
&gt; And no, please no flaming, I have no intention to provoke someone. All I<br>
&gt; say is: The Nvidia installer really works easily. And yes, you'll have<br>
&gt; to kick the installer after kernel upgrades. As easy as the Debian way<br>
&gt; these days. I would really appreciate some technical hint about the<br>
&gt; benefits of the Debian way other than &quot;the official installer suckz&quot;.<br>
&gt; And yes, of course I also read<br>
<br>
It simply comes down to the fact that using the nvidia installer<br>
overwrites packaged files and that is &quot;A bad thing&quot;(tm).<br>
<br>
&gt; <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers">http://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers</a><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; which says<br>
&gt; &quot;Advantages of &quot;the Debian way&quot;:<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * More automated, which saves work if the kernel is changed. &quot;<br>
&gt; and I disagree.<br>
<br>
Well I am thinking of trying to come up with a method that actually makes<br>
it try to compile the module if it is missing at boot.&nbsp; My wife thought<br>
it was rather unfriendly that her last upgrade (which gave her a new<br>
kernel) took away X.&nbsp; Sure recompiling the module with module-assistant<br>
was easy, but it had to be done manually.&nbsp; I will see if I can't find<br>
a way to automate that for those users that want it.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; i.e. edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf -remove 'nivida' and replace with 'nv'<br>
&gt; &gt; very handy when the compile fails.<br>
&gt; &gt; and it will.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Oh yes. ;-)<br>
<br>
Sometimes it does. :)<br>
<br>
Also the nvidia installer for a long time hasn't worked with debian's<br>
2.6.29 and higher kernels because they are now kbuild only (and hence<br>
don't allow compiler tests that the nvidia installer used to work unless<br>
they get converted to kbuild).&nbsp; I am not sure if it works with it yet.<br>
Those running their own kernels would of course never notice that problem<br>
since they have the full sources installed the way the nvidia makefiles<br>
assumed it would be.&nbsp; This same kernel header change also turned vmware<br>
modules into a nightmare as well as a few other out of kernel drivers.<br>
