<font size="2"><div class="PlainText">Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to <br>
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people <br>
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small <br>
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people <br>
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _<br>
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. <br>
<br>
Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right <br>
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac <br>
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on <br>
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share <br>
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) <br>
<br>
Robb Beal wrote[4]: &quot;Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company <br>
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's <br>
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)&quot; Well _duh_. Your product would have to <br>
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just <br>
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 <br>
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same <br>
amount of money. <br>
<br>
Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. <br>
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. <br>
<br>
But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going <br>
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category <br>
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs <br>
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people <br>
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed <br>
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment <br>
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that <br>
magic 25 multiplier.<br>
