&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; XFS is the canonical fs for when you have lots of Big Files.&nbsp; I've<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats cool. What about Lots of Little Files? That was another of the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; draws of reiser3.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That same unofficial benchmark showed surprising small-file speed by<br>
&gt; &gt; xfs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Would you happen to have any links to such benchmarks, unofficial or<br>
&gt; otherwise?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My experience has been that whenever I look at filesystem benchmarks,<br>
&gt; they skip the many-small-files case.&nbsp; I've always had the feeling that<br>
&gt; most of the big filesystems cared a lot about scaling up in file-size,<br>
&gt; but not too much about anything else.<br>
<br>
NB: This is my best recollection; I'm not looking this up right now.&nbsp; Please <br>
check my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
Some of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, which <br>
I believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.&nbsp; Some of that also came <br>
from tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and <br>
should be in btrfs.&nbsp; The final edge reiserfs had was above-average <br>
flushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs have <br>
likely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching <br>
system in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.<br>
<br>
&gt; I'm a Reiser3 user myself, and I've never had any problems with it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (The trouble with it being &quot;long in the tooth&quot; is mostly hypothetical,<br>
&gt; isn't it?)<br>
<br>
Not really.&nbsp; Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very <br>
long time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated to <br>
use the new interface.&nbsp; However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that <br>
will not be fixed.&nbsp; Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the <br>
reiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on the <br>
ext2/3/4 or xfs code.<br>
<br>
In addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less <br>
attractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate away <br>
from it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outside <br>
of generic file system migration tools.&nbsp; Compare with btrfs_convert which <br>
allows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying; <br>
such tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system and <br>
fewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.&nbsp; The <br>
source will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in file <br>
systems are not interested in reiserfs.<br>
<br>
There's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no <br>
pressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file <br>
systems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiserfs.<br>
