<span class='headerLineTitle'>Subject:</span><span class='headerLineText'>[Infoworld] Ballmer describes what a Chief Software Architect does</span><br/><br/>
<font size="2"><div class="PlainText">Rohit was wondering what Microsoft's definition of a Chief Software<br>
Architect is (and, consequently, what Microsoft thinks is a roadmap).<br>
Here you go, from Mr. Ballmer to Mr. Gillmor to Mr. FoRK...<br>
Architecture is war; love 'em or hate 'em, at least Microsoft<br>
understands that: as Chief SA, BillG oversees all product strategy.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper<br>
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up<br>
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision<br>
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...<br>
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we<br>
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in<br>
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough<br>
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software<br>
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends<br>
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that<br>
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],<br>
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --<br>
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for<br>
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the<br>
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the<br>
right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;People talk about what it takes to be a good manager, and people talk<br>
about being a good coach and getting people to like you. In a large<br>
organization those things are important, but at a certain level, ... the<br>
most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is<br>
to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other<br>
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is<br>
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From<br>
my perspective, it is the P&amp;L; [profit and loss] structure and the<br>
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a<br>
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the<br>
parts will mean we have better offerings.&quot;<br>

<br>
Ballmer in charge <br>
July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PT<br>
<br>
NO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net<br>
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the<br>
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well<br>
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center<br>
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at<br>
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes<br>
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's<br>
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and<br>
partners.<br>
<br>
&gt; Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net<br>
&gt; era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?<br>
<br>
Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution<br>
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe<br>
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four<br>
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key<br>
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but<br>
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that<br>
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which<br>
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,<br>
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is<br>
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about<br>
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.<br>
<br>
So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the<br>
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were<br>
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But<br>
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next<br>
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with<br>
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It<br>
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that<br>
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It<br>
is all about interoperability and connection.<br>
<br>
So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple<br>
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have<br>
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit<br>
Suisse, Marks &amp; Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who<br>
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front<br>
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.<br>
<br>
&gt; How so?<br>
<br>
Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;<br>
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first<br>
batch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual<br>
Studio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel<br>
good about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not<br>
to say that other people aren't doing some reasonable bolt-on XML<br>
support for the stuff they have.<br>
<br>
&gt; You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and<br>
&gt; partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard<br>
&gt; for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?<br>
<br>
We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within<br>
the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction<br>
and trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some<br>
things I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have<br>
increased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot<br>
of the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the<br>
fix, but sometimes we can't get the tools in their hands to deploy those<br>
fixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and<br>
there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We<br>
are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to<br>
&gt; Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.<br>
<br>
No, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we<br>
will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our<br>
customers' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who<br>
are pushing back really don't even know the new terms.<br>
<br>
&gt; Isn't that your fault for not educating them?<br>
<br>
Yes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose<br>
companies already have licenses, and they are saying, 'I think there's a<br>
problem.' I don't deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some<br>
issues we will have to work on over time.<br>
<br>
After July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was<br>
talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would<br>
be a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his<br>
company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to<br>
his company are now lower than they were before. And he said, 'Oh really?'<br>
<br>
So we'll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed<br>
licenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger<br>
concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be<br>
some issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.<br>
<br>
&gt; How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server<br>
&gt; developers work together? <br>
<br>
What we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the<br>
company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of<br>
the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, ¸ber-road map<br>
of where we are going.<br>
<br>
Now there are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper<br>
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up<br>
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision<br>
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...<br>
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we<br>
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in<br>
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough<br>
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.<br>
<br>
Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software<br>
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends<br>
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that<br>
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],<br>
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --<br>
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for<br>
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the<br>
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the<br>
right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT.<br>
<br>
People talk about what it takes to be a good manager, and people talk<br>
about being a good coach and getting people to like you. In a large<br>
organization those things are important, but at a certain level, ... the<br>
most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is<br>
to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other<br>
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is<br>
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From<br>
my perspective, it is the P&amp;L; [profit and loss] structure and the<br>
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a<br>
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the<br>
parts will mean we have better offerings.<br>
<br>
&gt; It seems the scenarios construct is really working for you. Is this an<br>
&gt; evolution of the solutions approach? <br>
<br>
I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions<br>
stuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I<br>
think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because<br>
solution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of<br>
the things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make<br>
them into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What<br>
will software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it<br>
involves Windows, Office, and other applications.<br>
<br>
We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the<br>
parts. That's not to say people are always comfortable with this. I<br>
can't even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot<br>
better than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step<br>
forward for the customers.<br>
<br>
&gt; Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars<br>
&gt; Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of<br>
&gt; a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.<br>
<br>
I would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come<br>
together and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting<br>
process here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of<br>
input. [But] once it is decided, people don't get to vote with their feet.<br>
<br>
We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve<br>
pulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do<br>
that. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don't say<br>
they want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, 'Ahhh, I get<br>
it. That makes sense.'<br>
<br>
I don't want to go to six more meetings where people say, 'Is your<br>
workflow strategy BizTalk?' ... Or 'What's your Office workflow<br>
strategy?' Or 'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and<br>
Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?'<br>
<br>
To get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level<br>
road map to work -- you have to build something we don't have today. So<br>
we have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get<br>
all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you<br>
just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand<br>
flowers blooming.<br>
<br>
&gt; In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors<br>
&gt; are, and it was the usual suspects. But one you didn't mention is<br>
&gt; yourself. You are competing against the last generation of your technology.<br>
<br>
Always. Given that our stuff doesn't wear out or break down -- you can<br>
question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn't<br>
break down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we<br>
have to have something interesting and innovative.<br>
<br>
People think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more<br>
new product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems<br>
integration so they don't have to get involved in that. So take<br>
Sharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold<br>
Team Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new<br>
SKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down<br>
level with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we<br>
could do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put<br>
things together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which<br>
are then 'upgrades' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But<br>
no matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to<br>
convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than<br>
the older idea we had.<br>
<br>
And there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given<br>
product or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you<br>
that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that<br>
you will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of<br>
this whole licensing discussion we are having.<br>
<br>
We moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we<br>
wanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I<br>
guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we<br>
were. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning<br>
the new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will<br>
eventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated<br>
over the years, and some people came to not understand it all.<br>
<br>
The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don't<br>
want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do<br>
have new ideas, it's like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that<br>
one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have<br>
access to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we<br>
have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with<br>
hitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the<br>
customer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are<br>
licensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.<br>
<br>
&gt; That gets back to the trust issue, where if you front-load it, that's<br>
&gt; the big, lumpy upgrade; and if you back-load it with the vision, the<br>
&gt; .Net 2003 servers, you have a long gap in the middle where you have to<br>
&gt; sell into an untrusting audience.<br>
<br>
The truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you<br>
can only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It's not like some<br>
sort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the<br>
storage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably<br>
the shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going<br>
to change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features<br>
in PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.<br>
<br>
I think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to<br>
deliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to<br>
see that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is<br>
lumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a<br>
confidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,<br>
our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.<br>
<br>
We know that, but we don't know exactly what that means yet. And this<br>
whole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or<br>
business discussion. It's how does software get rearchitected in the<br>
world of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are<br>
fundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the<br>
anti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus<br>
support in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows<br>
Update. Now that's a small piece of software, but it is big. That's the<br>
consumer market; we've got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.<br>
<br>
&gt; The lack of broadband build-out and adoption seems to be holding up<br>
&gt; the ability for users to take advantage of some new services you're<br>
&gt; talking about. When Bill [Gates] invested in Comcast cable, it<br>
&gt; triggered the Baby Bells to get on board with DSL. What are you doing<br>
&gt; now to deal with that issue?<br>
<br>
The No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that<br>
people will start saying, 'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.'<br>
<br>
&gt; And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?<br>
<br>
Yes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was<br>
not wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless<br>
network available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I<br>
don't know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I<br>
don't know whose broadband I used. I didn't see it in Bill's room. I<br>
called him up and said, 'Hey, come over to my room.' So soon everyone is<br>
there and connecting to the Internet through my room.<br>
<br>
We have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General<br>
Packet Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision<br>
from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable<br>
modems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not<br>
many things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If<br>
I am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you<br>
can do things with speed that you otherwise can't do without speed, that<br>
is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.<br>
<br>
That's the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn't it<br>
awful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I<br>
agree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,<br>
there was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have<br>
gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8<br>
million [subscribers].<br>
<br>
&gt; So how do we make that happen in this country?<br>
<br>
I think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the<br>
consumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today's<br>
prices or tomorrow's prices, that is going to shake out the<br>
marketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just<br>
have to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to<br>
live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or<br>
cable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]<br>
Craig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off<br>
of [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also<br>
think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,<br>
'Aren't we, too, some of that bottleneck?' We have not built software<br>
that makes broadband a must-have.<br>
<br>
&gt; Microsoft CEO weighs in<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Ballmer addresses a number of key issues for customers and partners.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On security and trust: &quot;There are some things I would have done<br>
&gt; differently.&quot;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On coordinating product groups: &quot;We are working hard to make sure<br>
&gt; the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; On product licensing: &quot;We are still going to have to get smart<br>
&gt; about the full ramifications.&quot; <br>
<br>

----<br>
aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly<br>
incompatible approaches [REST &amp; SOAP] together.&nbsp; I'll sketch it out<br>
below, both in prescriptive form.&nbsp; Note: while this is proscriptive, it<br>
is expected that local adaptations will be provided.<br>
<br>
1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.<br>
By persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical<br>
life expectancy of days or greater.&nbsp; Ensure that each instance has a<br>
unique URL.&nbsp; When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.<br>
<br>
2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each<br>
representation.&nbsp; Unlike traditional object oriented programming<br>
languages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there<br>
will be a single representation of the entire instance.&nbsp; These<br>
representations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or<br>
references) to other instances.<br>
<br>
3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,<br>
update, and delete operations.&nbsp; A key aspect of the design is that<br>
messages for these operations need to be self contained - both the<br>
sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of<br>
assumptions as to the other's state, and multiple requests should not be<br>
required to implement a single logical operation.&nbsp; All requests should<br>
provide the appearance of being executed atomically.<br>
<br>
4. Query operations deserve special consideration.&nbsp; A general purpose<br>
XML syntax should be provided in every case.&nbsp; In addition, when a<br>
reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a<br>
relatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP<br>
GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be<br>
provided.<br>
<br>
Implications&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from<br>
the &quot;pure&quot; (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.<br>
<br>
1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of<br>
modifying multiple resources.&nbsp; PUT and DELETE operations are rarely<br>
used, if ever.&nbsp; GETs may contain query arguments.<br>
<br>
2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change<br>
the state of the recipient.&nbsp; POST should be used instead.<br>
<br>
3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that<br>
they identify the resource.&nbsp; In particular, recognize that URLs can be<br>
dynamically generated.&nbsp; Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in<br>
responses.&nbsp; Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.<br>
<br>
4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.<br>
Allow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.&nbsp; Use<br>
HTTP GET for retrieval operations.<br>
<br>
Conclusions&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Looking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols<br>
that emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking<br>
protocols of the next decade.&nbsp; Both REST and SOAP contain features that<br>
the others lack.&nbsp; Most significantly:<br>
<br>
REST - SOAP = XLink<br>
<br>
The key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the<br>
ability to link together resources.&nbsp; SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress<br>
in addressing this.&nbsp; Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.<br>
<br>
SOAP - REST = Stored Procedures<br>
<br>
Looking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some<br>
key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.<br>
<br>
Finally, it bears repeating.&nbsp; Just because a service is using HTTP GET,<br>
doesn't mean that it is REST.&nbsp; If you are encoding parameters on the<br>
URL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving<br>
the representation of a resource.&nbsp; It is worth reading Roy Fielding's<br>
&nbsp;thoughts<br>
on the subject.&nbsp; The only exception to this rule that is routinely<br>
condoned within the REST crowd is queries.<br>
