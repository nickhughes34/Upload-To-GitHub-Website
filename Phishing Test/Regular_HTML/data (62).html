Loo rolls of honour and the invisible man<br>
<br>
Paper Clips: A round-up of the weekly press<br>
<br>
By Steven McCaffery<br>
<br>
The powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an <br>
ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale <br>
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The <br>
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which <br>
originated in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
&quot;A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,&quot; the columnist reports.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is then explained: &quot;He had paid £625 to a local sorcerer and <br>
believed that he was invisible.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.<br>
<br>
&quot;A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through <br>
three walls to steal £10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an <br>
attack which was well planned and professional,&quot; the paper reports.<br>
<br>
&quot;The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop <br>
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition <br>
between the back hallway and the front shop.<br>
<br>
&quot;Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then <br>
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the <br>
contents.&quot;<br>
<br>
The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole <br>
left in his store and is quoted as saying: &quot;On Monday morning when my <br>
wife was opening, everything looked normal.<br>
<br>
&quot;But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the <br>
shop next door.&quot;<br>
<br>
The paper reports that the shop was the target of &quot;another well <br>
organised crime&quot; 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.<br>
<br>
The shop's owner says: &quot;The closer it gets to Christmas the more <br>
people are going to be open to this.&quot;<br>
<br>
The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the <br>
Down Democrat.<br>
<br>
Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the <br>
authorities to &quot;birch the vandals&quot; plaguing the local community.<br>
<br>
He is shocked at reports of the &quot;wanton destruction by vandals&quot; and <br>
issues a call for action.<br>
<br>
&quot;The time has come to fight fire with fire,&quot; he writes, &quot;before <br>
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start <br>
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of <br>
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.&quot;<br>
<br>
As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, <br>
controlled violence.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the <br>
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.&quot;<br>
<br>
Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly <br>
liberal who may oppose his plan.<br>
<br>
&quot;In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is <br>
the order of the day.<br>
<br>
&quot;You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures <br>
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal <br>
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in <br>
the late 1980s.<br>
<br>
&quot;However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing <br>
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before <br>
it numerically passes Christianity.&quot;<br>
